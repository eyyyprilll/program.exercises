Define a function write_to_file(sentence, choice):
Open "mylife.txt" for appending.
Based on the choice:
If choice is 'yes', write the sentence to the file and return True.
If choice is 'no', print a message and return False.
If choice is neither 'yes' nor 'no', print a message and return False.
Initialize continue_writing to True.
Start a loop:
Prompt the user for a sentence and a choice.
Check if the script is run as the main program and call main.
